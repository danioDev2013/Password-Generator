# Password Generator

## Description
---
This is a password generator. In today's tech world, many of us have accounts online or different devices, that request a password. In order to keep our sensitive data safe from hackers, we need strong passwords. If like me, you struggle with coming up with a unique password, then this generator will help you. I wanted to be able to create many different unique strong passwords for my account, that way they will be harder to breach. It is safe and easy to use. 

I wanted to create an easy to use web application, which is responsive and clean. When the user clicks the generate button, I wanted it to respond and the prompts to be easy to follow. This is why I focused on Javascript. I definitely learned new skills and further understood some of the JavaScript concepts. 

    Some of the concepts I learned:
    * the documument method quearySelector, which returns the element selected
    * for loops
    * math random, understanding how to get it to work on an array
    * parseInt
    * Number isNaN
    * event listener's 
    
    I further understood:
    * while loops
    * if, else, else if
    * concat
    * how if else if comes in handy to check users imput
